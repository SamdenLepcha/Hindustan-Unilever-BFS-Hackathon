# Hindustan-Unilever-BFS-Hackathon
This repository contains our approach to Hindustan Unilever BFS Hackathon help at Unilever Offices in Bangalore.

We were assigned problem statement 1. The description of the exact problem statement is given below.

### Preventing Revenue Leakage and datasets
HUL have 436 Lakme salons: company run salon or franchise salon. Revenue leakage happens from underbilling, wrong discounts, bypass system and double discounts or discounts to customers who are not eligible.
- Audit every single salon all through the year (manual bill book, card statement reconciling with bank, any appointments have been deleted, expired products and stock counting, etc.
- Power BI to throw outliers in certain matrix (eg if same service has been given to a customer in a single day, calling customer)

The actual problem statement had 3 parts to it:
1. Detect anomaly from sales data.
2. Detect under-usage and over-usage of material from inventory data.
3. Count footfall in a store from CCTV data.

#Important Disclaimer: The data has been not published. It has also been hidden from the code due to security concerns. The code just describes our methodology and can be used as an effective way for anomaly detection from sales data.
